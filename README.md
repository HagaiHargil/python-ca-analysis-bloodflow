# Calcium and Bloodflow Analysis

## By Hagai Hargil

This script allows the user to mark ROIPOLY-style regions of interest
in a `.tif` stack and see the changes in fluorescence inside that ROI.
Basically it's a quick and dirty version of bigger calcium analysis scripts.

The second part of this script, which can be run independently, is the
analysis of data generated by Patrick Drew's bloodflow analysis script. This 
script takes the output of Patrick's and plots it nicely, together with the calcium
traces of that same ROI.

The last part of the script is the comparison between the two. This has yet
to be written.
